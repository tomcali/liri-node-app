# Week 10 Assignment: liri-node-app

## Overview
This assignment concerns node.js and its use as a tool for interacting with web APIs and the local file system. It sets the stage for later work with node.js as a database and web server. 

I work through the instructions for the assignment and explore few additional node.js features and packages in the process. By far my favorite assignment of the term so far. 

## Viewing the Websites

The GitHub repository shows the work on this assignment.

## Requirements
The requirements for this assignment may be found in the file homework_instructions.md.

## Technologies Used

- Git/GitHub
- node/npm with initial npm init to set up package.json
- Twitter API via node twitter


## Coding Process 
- We start with GitHub, setting up the repository liri-node-app 
- Clone the repository and set up the files required for this assignment, including .gitignore, keys.js, random.txt, and liri.js 
- npm init to set up package.json
- Obtained Twitter credentials
- Utilize appropriate node packages to complete the tasks required for the assignemnt
- Set up utilities directory to accommodate user-defined modules... anticipating future node app development work, included set operations as part of this utilities directory (not part of the assignment, but something that will help in  future projects). Utilized index.js approach to this utilities directory.
- Wrote code needed to read the keys.js file, which set up the twitterKeys object with the appropriate authorization codes for accessing twitter APIs. This work utilized the fs module from the standard node environment and require. Again, we are working with keys.js under the utilities directory.
