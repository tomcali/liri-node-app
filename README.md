# Week 10 Assignment: liri-node-app

## Overview
This assignment concerns node.js and its use as a tool for interacting with web APIs and the local file system. It sets the stage for later work with node.js as a database and web server. 

I work through the instructions for the assignment and explore few additional node.js features and packages in the process. By far my favorite assignment of the term so far.
